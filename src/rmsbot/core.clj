; Hi guys :-)

; Let's try some Clojure today =)

; The clojure documentation can be found on: http://clojure.org/
; or if you miss inspiration for HTTP usage: https://github.com/ornicar/vindinium-starter-clojure/blob/master/src/vindinium/core.clj

; Have fun !

(require 'clojure.edn)


(defn tweets-channel
  "Create a channel of tweets"
  []
  ; elements pushed in the channel are [ the-tweet-id the-tweet-content topic ] 
  ; example: ["424242424242" "I love linux" "linux"]
  ; example of topics: ("linux", "opensource", ...)

  ; TODO figure out how to return a "channel" from the twitter stream api

  ; TODO ideally, we should also try to use the descriptive sheet "_index" of the Spreadsheet to search & exclude tweets.
  ; this can come in a second priority feature
)

(defn detect-language
  "Determine the language of a tweet"
  [tweet-text]
  ; Use https://detectlanguage.com/ for this
  "en"
)

(defn pick-answer
  "Pick an answer for a given topic and language. For instance, 'linux' and 'fr' might be: 'Vous devez dire GNU/Linux.'"
  [topic lang]
  ; TODO a tuple of [topic lang] can have multiple variants. We can randomly pick one.
  ; TODO Ideally we should use the Google Spreadsheet, retrieve the sheet of the topic, the language column, and then randomly pick one row
  "This is GNU/Linux, not Linux!"
)

(defn tweet
  "Tweet an answer to a given tweet (referenced by id) â€“ or just tweet something when tweet-parent-id is nil"
  [tweet-text tweet-parent-id]

  (println "tweeting..." tweet-text)
  ; TODO obviously use the twitter API
  true
)

(defn -main
  "RMS bot main function."
  [& args]

  ; TODO we need to iterate over tweets-channel
  ; See also http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core.async/go-loop

  ; then for each tweet apply following:

  (let [
        [tweet-id tweet-text topic] ["42424242424242" "I love linux" "linux"] ; mock data
        lang (detect-language tweet-text)
        to-tweet-text (pick-answer topic lang)]
    (tweet to-tweet-text tweet-id))
  ; should this by try catched in the main loop? :-D
)
